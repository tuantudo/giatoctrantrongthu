description: Audit compliance with AGENTS.md, PROJECT_CONTRACT.json, Human Gate and handoff rules.
---

## Purpose
Audit compliance with AGENTS.md, PROJECT_CONTRACT.json, Human Gate and handoff rules.

## When to use
When checking governance drift or before a state transition.

## Required evidence
- File paths and line numbers for every claim.
- Classification tag per claim: [FACT] [OBSERVATION] [INFERENCE] [HYPOTHESIS] [PROPOSAL] [HUMAN GATE].

## Workflow
1. Read only the minimum files needed to answer.
2. Prefer grep/glob/read over shell pipelines.
3. Do not run heavy commands or network calls unless the task needs them.
4. Do not edit any file.
5. Do not assign work to other agents.

## Output
Finding list with severity; no edits to governance files.

## Prohibited behavior
- Editing source, data, schema, or production.
- Treating old Agy proposals as authority.
- Canonicalizing sitemap/IA without Human Gate.
- Spawning subagents by default.

## Human Gate
Any proposed change to ontology, brand meaning, sitemap canonicalization, genealogy data, or governance policy must be surfaced as [HUMAN GATE], not executed.
